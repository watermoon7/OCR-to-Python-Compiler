# OCR-to-Python-Compiler
Translates OCR Reference Language into Python

To use the compiler, navigate to the root directory and type the following command
  python ocrcompiler/testing.py
The file 'test2.ocr' will be translated and save in a file called 'test2.py'

There is much to do such as
  - implement classes (they're kind of broken)
  - fix nested do untils
  - add a gui
  - make it into a package
  - add comments
  - clean up the horendous code
  - write documentation
  - finish the writeup for the project
  - :( there is a lot to do
